		<p>As I was going to St. Ives, I met a man with <span class="times">7</span> wives.</p>
		<p>Every wife had <span class="times">7</span> sacks, and every sack had <span class="times">7</span> cats, and every cat had <span class="times">7</span> kittens.</p> 
		<p>Kittens, cats, sacks, and wives, how many were going to St. Ives?</p>
