		<p>The course is an introduction to the "coding side" of web development: you will learn how to <em>build</em> web pages without relying on user-friendly tools that can do it it for you.  	
		
		<p>What use is this knowledge? Anyone can create a website with WordPress or any other content management system in minutes. However, such tools, while incredibly useful, limit you in what you can do. Yes, they can be customized in many ways. However, without the knowledge of how a web page works, you cannot easily change it to fit your needs; without the knowledge of styling, you cannot modify a theme; and without understanding the basics of programming, you cannot use all those free JavaScript programs that would add valuable content and functionality to your website.

		<p class="bar">xyz

		<p>Most importantly, knowledge of the technical side of web development, as well as the fundamentals of computing is an open door: with this foundation, you will be able to learn, even teach yourself, other technologies (programming languages, code libraries and frameworks, content management systems, etc.), use other people's code, and share your own.

		<h4 class="bar">learn</h4>
		
		<p> "Client-side code" refers to code that resides on the user's computer and runs in an Internet browser like Firefox, Chrome or Safari (i.e., the client), as opposed to "server-side code", which resides on the web server that hosts the website.

		<p>Although this course is only an introduction, you will be introduced to a lot of ideas and new skills. You will learn about core web technologies, how to display content on a web page - i.e., how to create simple websites with HTML and style them with CSS. You will also learn how to make that content "do" things  - i.e., how to write simple programs using JavaScript, how to use a JavaScript library like jQuery to create cool visual effects, and how to tap into public APIs (application programming interfaces) to add dynamic content and functionality to your own web pages.

		<p>The course is for beginners: there are no prerequisites, no coding background is assumed.
