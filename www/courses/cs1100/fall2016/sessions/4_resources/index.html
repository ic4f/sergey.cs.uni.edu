		<p>Welcome to the home of the Department of Computer Science at the University of Northern Iowa!
		
		<pThis is a great time to be in computer science, especially at UNI. Demand for IT professionals in Iowa and the Midwest grows faster than universities can produce graduates. The discipline of computing continues to push the boundaries of what is possible by discovering new ideas, building new kinds of systems, and bring new tools into the home, school, and office. If you want to be in the thick of the intellectual excitement that is changing every other discipline, then computer science is the place to be.
		
		<p>At UNI, you will encounter a faculty immersed in this excitement and dedicated to student achievement. UNI CS's undergraduate and master's students work closely with faculty members to explore the discipline of computing, learn skills they can use in the marketplace, and have the opportunity to do research that extends the field. The department is located in the Innovative Teaching and Technology Center, which occupies the renovated historic East Gym in the heart of UNI's picturesque campus.
