<h4>Debugging and validating your code</h4>

<p>Here's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Debugging_HTML">a good set of guidelines on how to debug your HTML</a>.

<p>When using the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C HTML validator</a> do not be scared by many errors: usually fixing the first one takes care of most of the rest (a missed quotation mark can cause a lot of errors to "trickle down" the source code: adding the missed quote could fix them all!)

<p>Overall, pay attention to detail: you are writing "for a computer" - and computers only follow instructions. Miss a character, and the precise instruction will fall apart. So when you see a mess, look at your code and try to imagine how a computer would read that code - i.e., character by character. Where, do you think, it could have seen a character that confused it?

<p>Also, pay attention to syntax highlighting in your editor: you will immediately see when something is off.
