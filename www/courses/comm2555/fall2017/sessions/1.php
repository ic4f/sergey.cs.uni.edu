<h4>Welcome to COMM 2555!</h4>

<p>Following is a recap of some of the key points we covered during our first day of class.

<p>1. All course material will be posted to this web site. 

<p>2. Please read the syllabus: it includes essential information about course policies, its structure, grading, etc.

<p>3. My office hours are on the syllabus; however. I tend to be available at other times. If I'm in my office, feel free to pop in.

<p>4. Technology. Most of the software we will be using in this class is free; all of it is available in any computer lab. However, we will be also using Adove products; mostly Photoshop, but also (at least once or twice) Adobe Illustrator - these are not free. Adobe Creative Cloud (which includes Photoshop, Illustrator, and a lot more) is available in all computer labs on campus. 

<p>If you want to install Adobe products on your personal computer, you will have to purchase a subscription from Adobe. The price I quoted in class (which we found on the UNI ITS website) is not accurate: you can get Creative Cloud for 19.99/month (or even cheaper, for $219/year), or you can get Photoshop and Lightroom for 9.99/month. <a href="https://creative.adobe.com/plans?plan=edu&promoid=KTROQ">Here's the link</a>.

<p>The free software consists of a text editor, a browser, and an FTP client. For a browser, use anything you like - it doesn't matter whether you use Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Internet Explorer. For a text editor, my recommendation is either <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>, <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> or TextEdit (the default Mac editor). For FTP, you may use <a href="https://winscp.net">WinSCP</a> or <a href="https://cyberduck.io">Cyberduck</a>. There are free. Filezilla is the software installed on the laptops we use in class; however, I do not recommend using Filezilla on your personal computer.

<p>Here are the two student organizations I mentioned in class that I highly recommend to you:

<h5>Digital Collective</h5>
<a href="https://digitalcollectiveuni.wordpress.com/">https://digitalcollectiveuni.wordpress.com</a>
<p>From the Collective's website: "We are all about getting smart for the future.  We help each other find internships, jobs, conferences, networking opportunities, and determine what skills you need to get your digital dream job."
<p>The faculty advisor is Dr. Bettina Fabos.
<br>Meeting time: Mondays, 6-7pm, Digital Media Hub

<h5>Women in Computing </h5>
<p>From Dr. Sarah Diesburg, faculty advisor: "Our purpose encourages women in computing and technology through outreach, leadership, fellowship and service. We promote opportunities for computing careers, scholarships, and professional development."  
<p>The first Women in Computing meeting of the semester will take place on Thursday, August 31 in ITTC 328 at 5:00pm. 

The organization doesn't have a website, but <a href="http://www.uni.edu/stemed/women-computing"> here's an article from STEM@UNI</a>. 

<p>Again, welcome to COMM 2555!
