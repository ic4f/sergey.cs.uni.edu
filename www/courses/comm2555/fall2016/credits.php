This course was initially created by <a href="http://www.uni.edu/fabos/">Dr. Bettina Fabos</a> as the foundational course of the <a href="http://ids.uni.edu">Interactive Digital Studies</a> (IDS) program. We keep updating and improving this course every semester. Many, if not most of the course materials used on this website have been created collaboratively.
