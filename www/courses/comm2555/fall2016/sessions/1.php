<h4>Welcome to COMM 2555!</h4>

<p>Following is a recap of some of the key points we covered during our first day of class.

<p>1. All course material will be posted to this web site. I'll try to post session notes as soon as I can, although I can't promise they will be up the same day of class throughout the semester. These notes will summarize what we discuss and will include links to additional resources, as well as code and any examples used in class.

<p>2. Please read the syllabus: it includes essential information about course policies, its structure, grading, etc.

<p>3. My office hours are on the syllabus; however. I tend to be available at other times. If I'm in my office, feel free to pop in.

<p>4. Textbooks and other sources. The HTML/CSS book is available online. Unless you prefer to have a hard copy (I often do), feel free to use the online version. We will be using additional readings, some of which are by the same author and are available online only - so we will be using his site in any case. The other book is not available online; however I recommend shopping around; we won't need it until mid-October, so you have time.

<p>5. Technology. Most of the software we will be using in this class is free; all of it is available in any computer lab. However, we will be also using Adove products; mostly Photoshop, but also (at least once or twice) Adobe Illustrator - these are not free. Adobe Creative Cloud (which includes Photoshop, Illustrator, and a lot more) is available in many (if not most) computer labs on campus. 

<p>If you want to install Adobe products on your personal computer, you will have to purchase a subscription from Adobe. The price I quoted in class (which we found on the UNI ITS website) is not accurate: you can get Creative Cloud for 19.99/month (or even cheaper, for $219/year), or you can get Photoshop and Lightroom for 9.99/month. <a href="https://creative.adobe.com/plans?plan=edu&promoid=KTROQ">Here's the link</a>.

<p>The free software consists of a text editor, a browser, and an FTP client. For a browser, use anything you like - it doesn't matter whether you use Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Internet Explorer. For a text editor, my recommendation is either <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>, <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> or TextEdit (the default Mac editor). For FTP, you may use <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>, <a href="https://winscp.net">WinSCP</a> or <a href="https://cyberduck.io">Cyberduck</a>. All these are free. 

<p>Here are the two student organizations I mentioned in class that I highly recommend to you:

<h5>Digital Collective</h5>
<a href="https://digitalcollectiveuni.wordpress.com/">https://digitalcollectiveuni.wordpress.com</a>
<p>From the Collective's website: "We are all about getting smart for the future.  We help each other find internships, jobs, conferences, networking opportunities, and determine what skills you need to get your digital dream job."
<p>The faculty advisor is Dr. Bettina Fabos.
<br>Meeting time: Mondays, 6-7pm, Digital Media Hub

<h5>Women in Computing </h5>
<p>From Dr. Sarah Diesburg, faculty advisor: "Our purpose encourages women in computing and technology through outreach, leadership, fellowship and service. We promote opportunities for computing careers, scholarships, and professional development."  
<p>The first Women in Computing meeting of the semester will take place on Monday, August 29th in ITTC 322 at 5:00pm. 

The organization doesn't have a website, but <a href="http://www.uni.edu/stemed/women-computing"> here's an article from STEM@UNI</a>. 

<p>Again, welcome to COMM 2555!
