<p>Thanks to your instructor's fascination with pointy-eared creatures (hobbits, Yoda, etc.), for this assignment you get to do something meaningful and useful! You'll get to help Yoda, the legendary Jedi Master. 

<p>Despite Master Yoda's wisdom, remarkable power, and intimate connection with the Force, speak well he does not. But that's where you come in, young padawans! 

<p>You are being tasked with rearranging (splicing) one of Master Yoda's most famous recorded quotes to make it grammatically correct. 

<p><b><a href="yoda.wav">DOWNLOAD THE QUOTE</b></a> (right-click to save target/link file)

<p><b>Specific tasks:</b> create a function called yoda() that takes no arguments, and:

<ul>
    <li>creates a sound object using the provided file
    <li>splices the sound so that the new quote reads "<b>When you reach 900 years old, you will not look as good</b>."
    <li>normalizes the new sound object 
    <li>returns the new sound object
</ul>

<p>Remember to normalize the new sound before returning it!
