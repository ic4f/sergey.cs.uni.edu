This is my academic/faculty website. It is run by a [front controller](www/app.php) that handles routing, initializes a few variables, then
loads and populates a [template file](www/template.php). The content is organized using physical directories - which is
the way I want it for this site. There's also a neat [Python script](utils/make_schedule.py) that
generates the HTML for my course schedule web pages.
